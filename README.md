# Binary-Decimal-Convertor-in-Python
This Python application creates a simple GUI interface using Tkinter for converting numbers between decimal and binary systems.

Application functionality:

• Decimal to binary conversion:

The user enters a decimal number in the input field.

Pressing the "Decimal to Binary" button converts the number to binary and displays the result.

• Binary to decimal conversion:

The user enters a binary number in the input field.

Pressing the "Binary to Decimal" button converts the number to decimal and displays the result.

• Deleting displayed results:

Pressing the Clear button clears the contents displayed in the output label.

• Graphical User Interface (GUI):

The application has an input_field.

Three functional buttons for conversion and clear (Decimal to Binary, Binary to Decimal, Clear).

A label to display the results (output_label).

A Convert button which currently has no functionality.

• Error handling:

If the user enters an invalid number (e.g. letters instead of digits), the application displays an error message.

• How does the code work?

Function decimal_to_binary(): transforms a decimal number entered by the user to a binary number.

Function binary_to_decimal(): Converts a user-entered binary number to a decimal number.

Function clear_output(): Clears the text displayed in the output label.

Tkinter interface: Creates windows, buttons and text fields for user interaction.
